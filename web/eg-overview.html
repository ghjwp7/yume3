directed into file u.)  abc, def, and ghi are shell scripts with
commands like "<code>echo This is def at `date`</code>".  Each time abc or def
executes, the output is appended to file t.  File t can be displayed
(on the console where abc-def-ghi was started) via the "cat t to
stderr" button.  Each time ghi executes, the output overwrites file
u.  File u can be displayed via the "cat u to stderr" button.

<br><strong>button-widths</strong> contains three yume commands
illustrating the -bw (button widths) switch without a -at switch.  The
generated menus are shown above (at 2/3 scale), within frames that show
their window titles.  (Frame appearance is window-manager-dependent.)
Menus 1 and 2 each use one -bw switch, with parameter "dc", which in a
line of two buttons gives the first button 4/7 of the line width, and
other button 3/7 of the line. (In the absence of a -at switch, overall
menu width is governed by the length of the longest line, which
depends on its number of buttons, the font, and the text content.)
Menu 3 has a "-bw dc" switch near its beginning, and a "-bw bbba" just
before the last line.  In this line of four buttons, the first three
each get 2/7 of the line width, and the other button gets 1/7.

<p><strong>date-of-file</strong> contains commands illustrating
yume's meta-mode controls.  A meta-mode control is a percent sign and
a code character at the beginning of a command, by which yume's usual
method of command invocation can be altered.  As noted in yume(1), a
command from a yume menu is executed by a shell via a forked copy of
yume, unless the command begins with a percent sign and a meta-mode
code character, in which case the invocation method depends on that
code character.</p>

<br><strong>example-starter2</strong> was the second version of a yume
menu to start yume examples.  It makes a menu with one button for each
executable file in the current directory -- several buttons in the
menu shown above are for executables that are not yume menu scripts
(abc, in-test-1, latex-2err, etc).
<p><strong>example-starter2</strong> and later example-starter
versions provide examples of menus created on-the-fly from strings in
environment variables.</p>

<br><strong>example-starter3</strong> was the third version of a yume
menu (shown half-scale) to start yume examples.  It uses strings in
environment variables to create its menu dynamically, making one line
of buttons for each qualified file in the current directory.  A file
is qualified if it's executable and contains "yume example" anywhere
in it, or "yume" first on a line of the file.  The left-hand button in
a menu line executes an example; the middle button displays the code
of the example; and the right-hand button displays an explanatory note
(if available) or is a no-op.
<p><strong>example-starter3</strong> uses button margins and quanta
  sizes in an attempt to make buttons of uniform size.  Note
  that <strong>example-starter4</strong>, the next example, uses -bw
  options rather than margins and quanta, to generate buttons that are
  pleasingly more uniform.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="example-starter3.txt">explanatory note</a>

  and <strong>xargs</strong> for proper quoting treatment of dynamic
  menu strings.

<br><strong>example-starter4</strong> is the current version of a yume

<h3>find-ls-count : xclip-with-yume example</h3></A>
<img src=../blob/master/web/eg-ss-27.jpg>
<br>Link to <a href="../blob/master/examples/find-ls-count">code</a>
<br><strong>find-ls-count</strong> contains a yume command with an
example of using xclip (a unix utility) to communicate with yume.  The
general idea is that you mouse-select some text and drop it on a yume
button, whose command uses xclip to get the text and use it in a
command.  In this example, the 'Find filename' button will list all
the filenames in the current directory that include the selected text.

<p>Here are a few comments about elements of this script: The
<PRE>     -at 100x400+77+7 </PRE> switch tells yume to locate a
100x400-pixel window's top left corner at (77,7), which will be quite
near the top of your display, not far from the left edge.  The switch
sequence 
<PRE>     -bu -la 'Find filename' \
     "V=\`xclip -o\`; echo \"Finding \$V in $D\"; find . | grep \$V" </PRE>

starts a button row with a button labeled "Find filename" that runs
the double-quoted command shown.  Note that two double-quote
characters within the command are backslash-quoted so they apply when
yume executes the command, rather than when yume starts.  Likewise,
the dollar sign (in the <CODE>\$V</CODE> instances) is
backslash-quoted to delay <CODE>$V</CODE> evaluation.
</p>

<p>The value of <CODE>`xclip -o`</CODE> (that is,
  left-quoted <CODE>xclip -o</CODE>) is current clipboard contents
  (ie, whatever text was most-recently selected).  When yume processes
  the whole command, the shell runs <CODE>xclip -o</CODE> and assigns
  the value to V.  The <CODE>echo</CODE> command displays the selected
  text and the current-directory name.  The <CODE>find</CODE> command
  finds all the filenames in and beneath the current directory and
  pipes them to <CODE>grep</CODE>, which selects those that contain
  the selected text.
 </p>

<p>Note, additional examples using <CODE>xclip</CODE> appear
  in <a href=#url-and-misc><strong>url-and-misc</strong></a>.  (The
  same examples appear individually in um4, um5, and um6.)

<h3>lac : C compilation aid</h3></A>
<img src=../blob/master/web/eg-ss-28.jpg>
<img src=../blob/master/web/eg-ss-30.jpg>
<br>Link to <a href="../blob/master/examples/lac">code</a>
<br><strong>lac</strong> contains a yume command that creates a menu
with several commands to compile, run, or edit a C program.  By
default, <strong>lac</strong> targets the most-recently-modified .c
file, but you can give <strong>lac</strong> any [.c] file name when
you start it.  Note, if <i>fn</i> stands for a filename, both of
"<strong>lac</strong> <i>fn</i>" and "<strong>lac</strong> <i>fn</i>.c"
act the same, using <i>fn</i> as the base name in the menu.</p>

<p>If you click the EE button at the left end of the top row, the text
  of the EE and <CODE>do:</CODE> buttons turns red, as shown in the
  second screen shot.  This shows that "entry execution" is turned on
  and that the compilation command in the text-box will execute
  whenever the mouse cursor crosses the <CODE>do:</CODE> button,
  rather than only when you click the <CODE>do:</CODE> button.
  (Clicking the EE button toggles EE state from on to off or from
  off to on.)  (The color change mentioned above assumes that a
  default version of file ~/.yume-gtkrc has been installed; if not,
  colors will differ.)
 </p>

<p>The <CODE>echo</CODE> command before the gcc command types a blank
  line, to tell the user the compile has begun; the <CODE>echo</CODE>
  command after gcc should produce a beep and blank line when the
  compile finishes.  Compile errors, if any, will be listed between
  the two blank lines.  [<small>Note, in the <CODE>echo -e '\a'</CODE>
  part of the command, <CODE>\a</CODE> stands for bell.  Depending on
  your shell, a bell may or may not sound.</small>]
</p>

<p>Before it makes a menu, <strong>lac</strong> tests the existence of
  half-a-dozen variables that specify window title, compiler name,
  compiler options, editor name, source file extension,
  and <CODE>make</CODE> setting.  If these variables (YTITL, YGCC,
  YOPTS, YEDIT, YEXT, and YMAKE) have not been set, 
  <strong>lac</strong> assigns them default values: lac, gcc, -O3
  -Wall, $EDITOR, .c, and nil.
</p>

<p> As just noted, when YEDIT isn't set, YEDIT defaults to $EDITOR.
   If in turn EDITOR isn't set, YEDIT then defaults to emacs.  If you
   ordinarily use some other text editor, set EDITOR appropriately.
   For example, with vim and bash, put the first of the following
   lines in file ~/.bashrc; or, with vim and csh, put the second line
   in ~/.cshrc :
   <pre>    export EDITOR=vim
    setenv EDITOR vim</pre>
 </p>

<p>In addition to the YOPTS option settings (which are <CODE>-O3
  -Wall</CODE> by default) <strong>lac</strong> may add
  a <CODE>-lm</CODE> switch to the compilation command that it
  generates.  This switch (referred to as MATHLIB
  in <strong>lac</strong> code) is set if grep finds
  "<CODE>&lt;math.h&gt;</CODE>" or any of certain math functions (sqrt,
  exp, log, etc) within the .c source file.  If you add math library
  references to your code after invoking <strong>lac</strong>, you can
  either run <strong>lac</strong> again, or type <CODE>-lm</CODE>
  within the <strong>do:</strong>-item's text box.  That is, in case
  of special circumstances, you can manually edit any of the text
  boxes as you like.  But if you find yourself frequently having to do
  manual edits, then either change <strong>lac</strong> or create a
  script to change it.  The next two paragraphs describe two possible
  customizations of <strong>lac</strong> via a script.  Both of these
  scripts appear in <strong>yume</strong>'s <strong>examples/</strong>
  directory.
</p>

<p>First, note that the <strong>lacc</strong> utility exports <CODE>
  YTITL=$0, YGCC="g++", YEXT=".cc", and YMAKE=make</CODE>.  Then it
  invokes <strong>lac</strong>.  This creates a C++ compilation aid
  instead of a C compilation aid.  The created menu has an additional
  <CODE>do:</CODE> group with a <CODE>make</CODE> command, as shown in
  red in the <a href=#lacc><strong>lacc</strong> screen shot</a>
  below.
</p>

<p>Secondly, the <strong>lacx</strong> utility exports <CODE>YTITL=$0,
  YEDIT=x2, YOPTS="-O3 -Wall -lX11 -lforms -lXpm", and
  YMAKE=make</CODE>.  Then it invokes <strong>lac</strong>.  This
  creates a C compilation aid suitable for
  compiling <strong>yume</strong> and other xforms-based programs.
  (Remove or edit the <CODE>YEDIT=x2</CODE> line unless x2 is an alias
  for your text editor.)

<h3>lacc : C++ compilation aid</h3></A>
<img src=../blob/master/web/eg-ss-32.jpg>
<br>Link to <a href="../blob/master/examples/lacc">code</a>
<br><strong>lacc</strong> uses <strong>lac</strong> to create a menu
with several commands to compile, make, run, or edit a C++ program.
By default, <strong>lacc</strong> targets the most-recently-modified
.cc file, but you can give <strong>lacc</strong> any [.cc] file name
when you start it.  For example, suppose you want to work with xyz.cc
and it isn't the most-recently-modified .cc file.  Instead of starting
<strong>lacc</strong> with the command "<code>lacc</code>", start
it with "<code>lacc xyz</code>" or with "<code>lacc xyz.cc</code>".
</p>

<p>To locate the most-recently-modified .cc file,
 <strong>lacc</strong> uses shell code like
 <pre>    FILE=`ls -t *.cc | head -1`</pre>
 (Note, other scripts like <strong>lac</strong> and
 <strong>lala</strong> use similar shell code, but with ".c" or ".tex'
 rather than ".cc".)
</p>

<p> The <code>ls -t *.cc</code> portion of this code makes a list of
 current-directory filenames that end with .cc, sorted by modification
 time; the <code>head -1</code> portion selects the first element from
 that list.  If the  current directory has no filenames that end with
 .cc, error messages like
 <pre>    ls: cannot access *.cc: No such file or directory
    egrep: .cc.cc: No such file or directory</pre> will appear, and the
 resulting menu will refer to "filenames" like .cc and .cc.cc.

<br><strong>lala</strong> contains a yume command that creates a menu
with several commands for processing latex files.  By
default, <strong>lala</strong> targets the most-recently-modified .tex
file, but you can give <strong>lala</strong> any file name when you
start it.  For discussion of "most-recently-modified" files, please
see topic <a href=#lacc><strong>lacc</strong>.</a>

<p>Clicking the EE button at the left end of the top row toggles the
 text color of the EE and <CODE>do:</CODE> buttons from black to red
 (or vice versa) as shown in the second screen shot.  The red color
 means that "entry execution" is turned on and that the command in the
 text-box will execute whenever the mouse cursor crosses
 the <CODE>do:</CODE> button.
</p>

<p>If you are using <CODE>xdvi</CODE> to view your <CODE>latex</CODE>
 output, and have entry execution turned on for
 the <CODE>latex-2ps</CODE> command, you can make and save a change to
 your .tex file, then move the mouse cursor across the
 red <CODE>do:</CODE> button, and after you hear a beep [indicating
 that <CODE>latex</CODE>, <CODE>dvi2ps</CODE>, and font generation
 (if needed) are done], move the mouse cursor into
 the <CODE>xdvi</CODE> window.  <CODE>xdvi</CODE> will detect that the
 .dvi file it is displaying has changed, and will display the new form
 of your document.  (Whether beep works is shell dependent.)
</p>

<p>Note, the <CODE>latex-2ps</CODE> script uses <CODE>latex</CODE> to
 process a .tex file.  latex-2ps runs latex invisibly unless an error
 occurs.  It beeps when done if <CODE>latex</CODE> finishes without
 error; but if a <CODE>latex</CODE> error occurs, it uses script
 <CODE>latex-2err</CODE> to present selected latex error log messages
 in an xterm window.  In other words, if <CODE>latex</CODE>
 and <CODE>dvi2ps</CODE> processing goes ok, <CODE>latex-2ps</CODE>
 beeps and is done; but if that processing has errors, 
<CODE>latex-2ps</CODE> invokes the <CODE>latex-2err</CODE> script to
 display some of the logged error messages in an xterm.  
<CODE>latex-2err</CODE> uses grep to suppress some <CODE>latex</CODE>
 error messages.  For example, it squeezes out messages containing "No
 pages" and "Overfull", among others.
</p>

<p> Script <CODE>latex-2ps</CODE> is used to <CODE>latex</CODE> the
 specified tex file if it's newer than its dvi file, or if an extra
 parameter is given after the file name.  The "x" at the end of
 each <CODE>latex-2ps</CODE> command just before the blue-line
 text-cursor mark in each screen shot is just such an extra parameter,
 used to force <CODE>latex</CODE> and <CODE>dvi2ps</CODE> processing
 regardless of file dates.  You may remove the x if you wish.

<img src=../blob/master/web/eg-ss-35.jpg>
<br>Link to <a href="../blob/master/examples/menu-at-var">code</a>
<br><strong>menu-at-var</strong> contains a yume command that creates
a one-button menu, near the top right corner of the screen.  The exact
location of the button depends on the hostname, as described in text
in <a href="menu-at-var">menu-at-var code</a>.

<p>The button pictured above was created on qili, and when it is
  clicked it opens an xterm that runs on qili and is displayed on the
  current display.
</p>

<p>Note, <code>menu-at-var</code> is mostly just a simple example of
  placing a menu at different locations for different cases, rather
  than a useful menu.  In practice, one would use a slightly
  longer <code>xterm</code> command, for example like:
 <pre> yume -bu -la yuli "xterm -e ssh yuli&" &</pre> which when run
 on qili would open a yuli xterm and display it on the current
 display.

<h3>play-sound-delay : Script example that plays a sound after a delay</h3></A>
<img src=../blob/master/web/eg-ss-36.jpg>
<br>Link to <a href="../blob/master/examples/play-sound-delay">code</a>
<br><strong>play-sound-delay</strong> contains a yume command to
create a menu as shown above.  When you click one of the numbered
buttons, a sound will be played after a delay of that many seconds.
If you click the <CODE>do:</CODE> button (with the command as shown) a
sound will be played after a delay of 3 seconds.

<p>Further discussion of <STRONG>play-sound-delay</STRONG> appears in
  its <a href="play-sound-delay">code</a> file.  But very briefly,
  the script structure is like:
<pre>  [ -z $1 ] && {
     &lt;yume command&gt;
     exit;
  }
  &lt;command to sleep $1 seconds, then play sound via play-sound-delay&gt;</pre>

The <CODE>[ -z $1 ] && { ... }</CODE> sequence says to test if
parameter 1 has zero length, ie, is missing.  If it's missing,
the <CODE>yume</CODE> command gets executed -- creating a menu that
contains recursive calls to <STRONG>play-sound-delay</STRONG>, as
shown above -- and the script exits.  But if parameter 1 is present,
it is treated as a number of seconds to sleep, after which a sound is
played.

<br><strong>screen-save</strong> contains a yume command to create a
menu with buttons labeled as shown above [that is, ls, ll, Show, exit,
Import, Import window, and Import w/ frame] for saving screen-shots
sequentially in a screen-saver directory.  The 
<a href="screen-save.txt">explanatory note</a> contains a page of
information about using the screen-save menu and adapting it to your
own preferences.

<p>Note, some useful adaptions can be made simply by supplying
  parameters to the <strong>screen-save</strong> invocation.  See
  comments near the beginning of its <a href="screen-save">code</a>.
  For example, the pictures for this web page have titles
  like <CODE>eg-ss-10.jpg, eg-ss-11.jpg,</CODE> and so forth.  These
  pictures were saved using a <strong>screen-save</strong> menu that
  was started by the command, "<CODE>screen-save . eg-ss- 1</CODE>",
  which saves pictures in current directory, gives them a prefix of
  "eg-ss-", and numbers them with an interval of 1.
</p>

<p>Note, the <strong>screen-save</strong> menu uses the
 <strong>screen-save</strong> script recursively to do different
 imports, supplying a fourth parameter to control what the script
 does.  For a simpler example and brief explanation of this technique,
 please see the closing paragraphs of the discussion of

<h3>svn-buttons : SVN utility aid</h3></A>

<br>Link to <a href="../blob/master/examples/svn-buttons">code</a>
<br>Link to <a href="../blob/master/examples/svn-buttons.txt">explanatory note</a>
<br><strong>svn-buttons</strong> makes a yume menu with buttons to
execute various svn commands. 
<p>Commands for the Subversion version control system typically have
the form "<code>svn V F</code>" where V is a verb and F is a filelist.
Examples: "<code>svn log myfile.c</code>" and "<code>svn cat
myfile.c</code>"
</p>
<p>Several commands have the form "<code>svn V</code>"; for example,
"<code>svn status</code>" and "<code>svn update</code>".
</p>
<p>To tell the menu where your svn-versioned files are located, type the
directory name into the "Directory D:" textbox.  (This will set
environment variable D within yume's environment.)  The path you type
into the textbox should be relative to the path shown on the line above
it.  (The screen-shot path has been blurred out.)
</p>
<p>To tell the menu the filelist that commands should apply to, type the
filenames into the "File list F:" textbox. 
</p>
<p>To execute an svn command with the verb add, proplist, status,
update, info, log, diff, cat, list, or commit, click the
correspondingly-named button.  Then svn will apply the verb to your
specified filelist.
</p>
<p>As you can see in the <a href="svn-buttons"> 
<strong>svn-buttons</strong> code</a>, the  "<code>Props-id $F</code>"
button will run the command sequence 
<pre> cd $D; svn propset svn:keywords "Date Id" $F</pre> which will
tell svn to enable expansion of $Date$ and $Id$ sequences within the
specified files.
</p>
<p>The  "<code>ls -l $F</code>" button will run the command sequence 
<pre> cd $D; ls -l $F</pre> which will show directory details of the
files in the filelist.
</p>
<p>The Subversion system comes with help files that can be accessed by
  commands of the form "<code>svn help V</code>", where V is an svn
  verb or an svn help topic.  To display help text on the console
  where you ran <strong>svn-buttons</strong>, put the topic name in
  the "Help Topic:" textbox and click the "Help Topic:" button.
</p>
<p>See <a href="svn-buttons.txt">explanatory note</a> for further
comments, if you don't want <code>EDIT=emacs</code> when an svn commit
is done.  (EDIT controls the editor that svn invokes for the user to

<br><strong>test-y-2</strong> contains a yume command to create a menu
as illustrated above.  The command string associated with the
"<strong>d+du</strong>" button is "<strong>%+date;du .</strong>",

<br><strong>test-y-4</strong> contains a yume command to create a menu
as illustrated above (at 3/4 scale).  The command in the top textbox
creates an xterm, displays a three-month calendar and current date and
variable M in it, then sets M and starts a shell.
</p>
<p>In like manner, one can create xterms set up for particular purposes.
</p>
<p> The other textboxes create equivalent xterms, aside from not
  showing or setting M.  The command beginning
  with <strong>%:</strong> is executed by invoking /usr/bin/xterm
  (within a forked copy of yume) directly rather than invoking /bin/sh
  (within a forked copy of yume) to invoke xterm.  The command
  beginning with <strong>%-</strong> invokes /usr/bin/xterm directly
  from yume, without forking.  Hence the yume menu disappears when the
  xterm opens in response to that command.

<h3>test-y-5 : Different-colored buttons example</h3></A>
<img src=../blob/master/web/eg-ss-43.jpg>
<br>Link to <a href="../blob/master/examples/test-y-5">code</a>
<br><strong>test-y-5</strong> contains a yume command illustrating use
of the <code>-de gtkrc</code> option switch to select a particular
gtkrc file, and in that file, setting the colors that will be used for
buttons in a yume menu.  The commands within this menu are not
particularly useful or interesting, but merely serve to populate a
menu so that button colors can be observed.

<p> A particular gtkrc file is selected by a yume option of the
following form: <code>-de gtkrc:nameoffile</code> .  For example,
test-y-5 says:
<pre> yume ...  -de gtkrc:./yume3-gtkrc-5A ...</pre></p>

<p> Note, if your home directory contains file <code>
.yume-gtkrc </code>, settings from that file normally are processed
by gtk_init() before settings from a -de specified gtkrc file are
processed.  You can suppress processing of <code>
~/.yume-gtkrc </code> via: <code>-de nogtkrc </code>.  The nogtkrc
flag does not suppress files mentioned by <code>-de gtkrc:</code> ,
however.
</p>

<p> In the gtkrc file, foreground and background colors can be
specified for various widgets in various states.  For example, the EE
buttons' normal font color and background color in this example are
given by:
<pre>
   style "y3ee"	= "y3m" { fg[NORMAL] = "blue"
                          bg[NORMAL] = "YellowGreen" }
</pre>
Style y3m, found at the beginning of yume3-gtkrc-5A, defines a
base-level color scheme for yume buttons.  Styles for specific
buttons can override whatever the user wants to be different from the
base-level scheme, in this case normal-status text color and button
background color.
</p>

<p>In this example, the topmost EE button has been clicked.  Thus,
that EE button is in Active state (for which, bg[ACTIVE] is "tan",
from y3m style), rather than Normal.  When an EE button is Active, its
associated do: button is named "y3dr" (for which, bg[NORMAL] is
"red2") rather than "y3dp" (for which, bg[NORMAL] is "blue", from y3m
style).  When the screenshot was taken, the mouse was over the large
'Bye-bye' button, which is sky-blue because y3m specified
bg[PRELIGHT]="SkyBlue".
</p>
<p>Note, the top three rows in this menu are -do groups in -dl form.
The middle two lines and the last line are ordinary -bu buttons.  The
"Item A"..."Item D" elements are from -iv shell-variable items.

<h3>test-y-6 : Single-, Double-, and Backslash Quoting examples</h3></A>
<img src=../blob/master/web/eg-ss-44.jpg>
<br>Link to <a href="../blob/master/examples/test-y-6">code</a>
<br><strong>test-y-6</strong> contains a yume command illustrating
some elementary usage of double quotes, single quotes, and 
backslash quoting.

<p> The first and last commands in the menu each produce the same two
error messages:
<pre>   /bin/bash: -c: line 0: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `''
   /bin/bash: -c: line 1: syntax error: unexpected end of file</pre>

(on a Linux system with /bin/sh linked to /bin/bash).  
</p>

<p><small>These error messages are mentioned in the "Dealing with
 errors in shell commands" subsection of the "DIAGNOSTICS, WARNINGS,
 CAVEATS" section of yume(1).  The "file" referred to in the error
 messages is just the command string that yume passed to /bin/sh.
</p>

<p>In unquoted shell strings, backslash is an escape character that
 quotes the character after it.  When it appears within a quoted
 string, backslash most commonly is treated as a literal character:
 always literal within a string quoted by single-quotes, else literal
 unless next character is "$", "\", or "`" and sometimes "!".  See
 sh(1).)  Thus, in the two commands with errors, the first
 single-quote matches the one just after the backslash.  The text from
 there to end of line isn't quoted text.  The single-quote at end of
 line begins a new section of quoted text, so sh begins looking for a
 matching single-quote; but as nothing follows, errors occur.</small>

<br><strong>um5</strong> illustrates use of xclip together with dc and

 Factor button gets a number (or numbers) from the clipboard, via
 "xclip -o".  It displays the factors of the number(s)."
</p>

<p>
For example, if you select text 12000 and click HMS, the following
will display:
<pre>    12000 seconds = 200.0 minutes = 3.33 hours = .13 days</pre>
or if you click Factor,
<pre>    12000: 2 2 2 2 2 3 5 5 5</pre>

dc is a reverse-polish arbitrary precision calculator.  The H:M:S

<pre>    /usr/bin/dc -e "60 1k12000r/p</pre>

which pushes 60; pushes 1; k pops 1 and sets precision to 1 digit;

<h3>wordexp-vals :  Shell Special
 Parameter expressions example</h3></A>
<img src=../blob/master/web/eg-ss-53.jpg>
<br>Link to <a href="../blob/master/examples/wordexp-vals">code</a>
<p><strong>wordexp-vals</strong> illustrates use of shell Special
 Parameter expressions $@, $*, $#, $?, $-, $$, $!, and $0 with yume.
 If your menus do not use any of these expressions, this example will
 not be relevant.
</p>

<p>Some parts of the following discussion require familiarity with the
 "Special Parameters" subsection of the "PARAMETERS" section of sh(1).
</p>

<p><strong>wordexp-vals</strong> contains a yume command
 like <code>yume -in wordexp-in</code>, where <code>wordexp-in</code>
 is a file with yume-parameter entries to make a menu as above (shown
 2/3 scale).  For each of the seven shell special parameter
 expressions $*, $#, $?, $-, $$, $!, and $0, <code>wordexp-in</code>
 contains a variant of the sequence
<pre>   -bu '%%echo Cash Zero is $0' "%%echo Cash Zero is $0"</pre>
 with appropriate substitutions for each special parameter other than $0.
</p>

<p>Thus, the menu contains seven lines with a pair of buttons on each
 line and each button label is the same as the command string it
 executes.  For each left button, the button's command is
 single-quoted (so the special parameter expands at button run time
 rather than yume run time), while for each righthand button, the
 button's command is double-quoted (so the special parameter expands
 only at yume run time).  The menu also has a one-button line for $@
 and an exit button.
</p>

<p>For $0, the left button will display [if /bin/sh is
 linked to /bin/bash] 
 <pre>   Y3:  echo Cash Zero is $0
   Cash Zero is /bin/bash</pre>
 while the  righthand button will display 
 <pre>   Y4: echo Cash Zero is yume
   Cash Zero is yume</pre>

 As noted in yume(1) and yume-meta(1), the <strong>%%</strong> meta-mode
 tells <strong>yume</strong> to print button's command on stdout each
 time before the command is executed.  The number between "Y" and ":"
 is the internal data structures index number of the button's command.
</p>

<p>This example is less complete than it should be, as it doesn't
 illustrate button-run-time differences between single- and
 double-quoted instances of $* and $@, nor does it illustrate values
 when <strong>%-</strong> or <strong>%:</strong> meta-mode is used.  In these non-shell meta-mode cases,
 wordexp [see wordexp(3)] is used to expand shell variables before
 command invocation.

<ul>
<li> <strong>xterms-w-sh</strong> turns on ShoMode =
  ShoAddObj+ShoWExp, which causes menu objects to be listed on stdout
  as they are added to internal data structures, and causes parameter
  expansions to be listed whenever wordexp [see wordexp(3)] is called,
  as will happen for the <strong>%:</strong> meta-mode commands.
<li> Xterms opened by <strong>xterms-w-sh</strong> use default fonts,
  colors, and sizes, rather than specified fonts and colors as
  in <A href=#test-y-4>test-y-4</a>.
</ul>
 Note, command strings that begin with meta-mode <strong>%-</strong>
 or <strong>%+</strong> <em>terminate the yume menu</em> when they execute.

<br><strong>yume-examples</strong> makes a yume menu with an exit
button and a button labeled "Show list of yume examples" -- a button
that runs <A href=#example-starter4>example-starter4</a>.
<p>A primary reason for <strong>yume-examples</strong> existing is to
  allow running examples without needing to cd
  to <strong>yume</strong>'s <strong>examples/</strong> before
  starting an example-starter.  Start <strong>yume-examples</strong>
  via a command like <pre> yume-examples yume/examples/</pre> -- that
  is, use a parameter to specify the location of <strong>examples/</strong>.
