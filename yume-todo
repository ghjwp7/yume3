In man page and/or .yume-gtkrc add refs to /etc/X11/rgb.txt and
http://cng.seas.rochester.edu/CNG/docs/x11color.html and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_color_names for colors list

man page line 380 has example:
    yume -de 'y3dr:(((Do)))' date -ex date
But this gets error:
  *** Error 17 at F:./src/yume3-p1.c L:205 D:0 Lookup error in y3dr:(((Do)))
Fix it.


[23 Jan 2018]

problem: make install overwrites ~/.yume-gtkrc without asking.
Perhaps don't overwrite (in plain make) if it exists.  But make gtkrc
could overwrite without asking.

Q: how to have PDF's of man pages available / archived without using
lots of space and cluttering up the repo.  Or does it not really
matter, ie is insignificant?

Write an auxiliary program or script that creates a table form, in
which one can write a yume script that then gets embedded into a
compiled yume3-caller.  [A limited but still capable version of
full-gui menu/forms designer.]  Column headings like row number or row
break, box kind, box color, fixed or default value, action code, var
name, etc.  Other data: output program name, target location.  Default
values can be overridden by run time parameters to the generated
program.

[25 Mar 2017 note:] In trying to get avr-yume-write-hex-including to
work ok with avr-yume-write-hex-single and similar menus, had to use
-Y7 repeatedly as the error messages did not pin down locations of
problems.  So: (1) perhaps store line #s/col #s during parsing, so
that error messages can tell where the problem occurred within the
input, and (2) fix whatever is causing the errors (some of them shown
below) 

Messages of the following forms are too opaque.  Also, yume man page
doesn't include anything about 'Bad width' errors.

*** Error 15 at F:./src/yume3-p2.c L:45 D:0   Bad width : 0 40
*** Error ERR_WEXP at F:m L:n D:n  wordexp failure n

The latter error (with numbers filled in) occurred whenever the
include file contained stuff like 'abc $SYM' or "abc $SYM" or 'abc
\$SYM' but if SYM had been exported, "abc \$SYM" worked ok.

Apparently, errors also occurred in include file processing when I
tried to use line ends without backslashes.  Need to check, since yume
man page says either is ok.  

Note, Bad Width errors seem to be due to wrong widths getting filled
in the .w field of some ListItem entries .  The problem seems to occur
in entry #40 to 42 during tests of avr-yume-write-hex-single,
avr-yume-write-hex-singleX, avr-yume-write-hex-singleY.  In
particular, "40.  et12.0 Exitor 4 w 26 <Exit> <exit> []" shows up
occasionally (say about 3 times out of 10) for the -singleY menu, with
"40.  et12.0 Exitor 4 w 10 <Exit> <exit> []" showing up the rest of
the time, apparently randomly.  Both 10 and 26 result in overly wide
menus, 2000 to 5000 pixels wide.  Adding/changing the -bw aa flag
didn't have a clear effect yet.

Near line 248 of yume3-p1.c changed `widthString = aj;` to
`widthString = setTxtBuf(aj); // make a copy of argv[] aj;` Half a
dozen other places in yume3-p1.c use setTxtBuf() to make copies.  I
may have thought widthString didn't need a copy.  This change fixed
width problem for -singleY, -singleX and -single menus; eg -singleX
gets bad-width message with old yume3 but not with new.

Note, need to set up git for yume3 next release

[end 25 Mar 2017 note]



-de rh:n to set row-height of n rows.  rowH var tells y3p2 how many
 table rows to use for each table (actual row), and buttons are
 created with vertical span from rb to re vals, in vars rowB and rowE.
 Eg: -de rh:4 sets rowH=4, rowB = 0, rowE=rowH-1.  Eg: What does -de
 rh:4 A B -de re:1 D E -de rb:2 -de re:3 F G H -de rb:0 I J look
 like???  Perhaps have a checkbox array, and during layout, mark out
 occupied cells.  When a command is encountered, put it into leftmost
 columns it fits into.  Problem: Don't know total width to make the
 checkbox.  Sol.: Not a problem, just make it indefinitely wide?? (How?)

done:
remove tre stuff - just go with linear search - tre is failing to
match wi, wo, ws, to wIconify, wOnTop, wStick, but matches wu to
wUndec as it is the last w* key.  Problem not easy to fix with tre
arrangement, where complicated code has to worry about branches before
values.  The linear search will have values in a separate array, eg an
array of shorts or bytes, and will match a string to the first key
that matches the entirety of the string.  So, eg, string "y3" will
match key y3da, "x" will match XYshow, "s" ShowMode, etc.  Note, short
matches will remain stable as keys are added at end of array so that
they don't intercept the short matches.   -- Besides
simpler search, the initialization will look much cleaner.  Eg, like:
const char *VVtag[]={"y3db", "y3da", ...  "xb", "bud", "bum" };

done:
Or, combine with dedata; change typedef struct { UC val, deco; } VVdata;
to  typedef struct { UC *key, val, deco; } VVdata;
and init with like  static VVdata dedata[Ndedata]={
  {"y3db", DoPush, DVww},       {"y3da", DoRoll, DVww}, 
...
  {"ShowMode", VVShoMo, DVini}, {"wIconic", VVIconi, DVini},
...
(instead of with numbers as in current version; can suppress the
comment after the numbers.)

in -bd maybe accept bit names or'd together?  Or maybe not, ie -bd
isn't set up like -de valpair, which has the or'ing already.  Perhaps
have bd as an LHS name, with a decoder that creates an or'd bit mask.
Eg: -de bd:bon+don+eoff which would do the same as three separate
-de's, namely -de bon -de don -de eoff.  Another problem: do decoders
apply to LHS items, but not to RHS???

Need bits to control: Push mode vs Roll mode bits for each button
type, b, d, e, i.  Visibility bits for each button type , to suppress
EE buttons when they aren't desired.   But before adding vis bits, see
if they actually work for this purpose


done:
make last letter of -bw repeat indefinitely & note so in yume.1

figure out why last row of yume-find-word-in-c is so wide.  Imagine
it's due to allocated width of entry field; how is that specified?
gtk_entry_set_max_length (GTK_ENTRY (obj), 7); in case InitVal: of
y3p2 was no help.

in yume2 sf pages, add reference to yume3

done:
yume3 problem: menus either not showing up, or (presumably) off
screen, due to problem with geometry or other params.  How to
identify/find/stop display such instances?  

done:
add options for (a) window not resizable, via
gtk_window_set_resizable() (b) undecorated window (no window borders),
via gtk_window_set_decorated() (c) auto_shrink on or off
gtk_window_set_default_size () or gtk_window_resize() (d) possibly
accept options for gtk_window_set_screen(), gtk_window_stick(),
gtk_window_maximize(), gtk_window_fullscreen(),
gtk_window_set_keep_above(), gtk_window_set_keep_below ().  (Issue:
will this blow up the exe size, for almost-never-used options??)

Re how to move undecorated windows, see
http://library.gnome.org/users/gnome-access-guide/stable/keynav-14.html.en

done: remove yume-meta.1 ref in yume.1; incorporate meta docs in
yume.1 and fix refs to yume3-gtkrc, sb yume-gtkrc and recheck err
list, ca line 660 in man yume on dixi

not:
See about exec'ing a different executable via execle().  There's a 
clean break between the get-parameters phase and 
the use-parameters phase of the application.  Might possibly 
have phase 1 write results on stdout and phase 2 read them on
stdin.  In typical use, a dozen instances of the app run for 
a few months at the same time, possibly started without write
access to a file structure (ie use pipe not file).

done: (differently)
To support label wrappers, need array char *label[2] or GtkWidget
*lab[2] in struct ListItem so that we can incorporate wrapper info
during phase 1.  In general, correct wrapper info won't be available
during phase 2.  Ie, whenever a new wrapper is spec'd in phase 1, the
old wrapper info disappears unless it has been incorporated into
label[] entry.  


Possible problem with 'entry' fields -- in yume2, didn't need to press
enter, after typing new text in field; with current code, box would
show (eg) 1234 if you type 34 after 12 in box, but retrieving the
field text gives 12, until after entry is pressed, when it gives 1234.

Re above, see http://www.gtkforums.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=9885
regarding use of "changed" rather than "activate"

obs:
Consider using a table for each menu.  Could set columns to
homogeneous widths, with EE spanning 1 column, Do: spanning 2, 3, or
more (depending on -dl or -do), and (for -dl) entry box taking up rest
of line.  Also, if -bw is specified, say -bw abcde, we would span 1
column for 'a' items, 2 for 'b' items, and so forth.  If -bw is not
specified, we would allocate numbers of columns based on string
lengths of labels.  Note, if we allocated 100 columns, the number of
columns spanned would equal to percent of menu allocated to item.  If
we allocated 60 columns, would have lots of divisors.  More
practically, we could add up the number of characters in labels in
various lines, then find number of columns that best fits the
distribution, eg by trying a dozen or so different column-counts.

obs:
Alternately, let user specify number of columns; and whenever another
number-of-columns setting appears, start a new table.  (Eg, R menu has
5 rows of 6 buttons each, and 2 rows of 5 buttons each.)  For this
plan, we have a window, then a vbox, and in the vbox, several tables.
In each table, we have several rows all with the same number of
columns.  (Some buttons may span multiple columns.)

done:
Need a -de setting to turn on/off the default rollover setting for
do-groups, and setting or initial of rollover for -bu buttons.
Also allow -iv buttons to rollover.

done:

Add -de keys gtkrc and nogtkrc: -de gtkrc=gtkrcfile adds a file to rc
load list and disables built-in ~/.yume3-gtkrc load, while -de nogtkrc
suppress loading any gtkrc file.


done:
Add -de keys buOn, buOff, eeOn, and eeOff, of type VVFLAG (see Data
conversion types section, below), for setting initial states of -bu
and EE buttons.  These settings remain in effect, affecting subsequent
-bu or EE buttons respectively, until next such flag.

Add -de vv:s form, where s is a string of key:val or key#:val pairs.
This is intended as a transfer mechanism of parameter strings
generated by external gui menu-design programs.

Add -de keys for user (or external design program) to specify 4
attach-points of following button.  This is to allow multi-row
buttons.  -de attach:x,x,y,y

Maybe add -de do:n such that the n terms after a -do are used as text
for a GtkComboBoxEntry widget with n choices.  In this alternate kind
of do: entry box,the current entry is the command executed when do:
button is activated.  Maybe factor the -dl/-do code into a subroutine?
Except not much help as so different.  But consider having tabbed
menus, which fits ok into the generally-linear-specifications model of
yume, unlike buttons of varying heights.

Or consider having option forms like -bu:n, -do:n, and -iv:n, where
n-entry GtkComboBox's or GtkComboBoxEntry's, respectively, are
desired.


done:
Button type style names: In yume3-gtkrc we will have some styles with
names like y3bu, y3ba, y3do, y3da, y3ee, y3td, y3iv, y3tv, and y3vb
corresponding to buttons for -bu, -bu rollover, -do, -do rollover, EE,
do: text entry, -iv, and -iv text entry, and to the VBox.  Generally,
buttons of a given type will use the style specified for them in
yume3-gtkrc.  The next paragraph is about allowing user to specify
different styles for individual buttons.

Consider letting the user specify new style names for each type of
button via -de sname settings.  Eg: -de sname:y3da:t3da make yume3 use
the name t3da for subsequent active do: buttons.  [Implementation
problem: need to store string, eg "t3da", in affected buttons.  Some
kinds of buttons (-iv, EE) need only one string; others (do:, -bu)
need two.  Also, upon each name change, need to show-widget again.]
[Because of cumbersome implementation, frightful documentation mess,
and no demonstrated need (as of yet) for this feature, I have no plans
to do it.]

Consider replacing do: buttons with a combo box, with first choice
being do: and other choice being ((do:)) for rollovers.  Oops,
probably not:  "When activated, the GtkComboBox displays a popup
which allows the user to make a new choice", which is what I want to
happen when the double arrow is clicked; when the choice itself is
clicked, I want to perform the do-group's action.  However, we might
change the separate EE button to an up/down arrow on the do: button.
Extending idea, could let user build dropdown menus for most buttons,
eg to have constrained do groups etc


done:
For yume3, get rid of all -de color-setting stuff [via gtkrc and
button style names as above].


done:
Add label wrappers [as below in Label Wrappers section] and add
control over EE and do: labels.

obs: (changed to linear search and yume3-init.c)
Fix -de decoding to use a trie instead of hashes, so that
minimal-distinct keys can be used.  Write program yume3-build.c to
build trie.  Note that yume3 make will still depend on an external key
file, but for download package, the keys should be embedded in
yume3-init.h such that yume3-build.c need not be compiled and run.


Data conversion types:


done: (differently)
Might want VV(x,tx) form for standard list of keys, where tx is a data
conversion type.  eg VV(gtk,VVSTR) or VV(gtk,VVARGS), and
VV(gtkrc,VVBOOL) or VV(gtkrc,VVFLAG).  For the VVARGS type, the val
part of -de gtkrc:val is split up via wordexp() and used as argv for
gtk_init() call.  For the VVBOOL type, var is set to 0 or 1 by the val
part of -de var:val while for VVFLAG, it is set to 1 by -de var with
no colon or value part needed.  Eg: -de nogtkrc, vs. -de
gtk:pathtogtkrcfile .

In the key processor, also read file yume3-rc which will contain
default settings for all switches that need to have them specified.
So yume3's behavior should be the same with or without -in yume3-rc at
beginning of option list, if yume3-rc is its standard self.

In yume3-p3.c, re waiter: If several kids are started in a short time,
in current code there will several timeouts running at once, but only
one is needed.  Need to find a race-free way to handle them.
Alternately, check out the overhead of just having each waiter
instance sit and wait for a single kid, without using repeated
timeouts.  

Check putenv() use.  Per http://www.seebs.net/c/growup.html at the
end, "When I got a chance to run purify on an application, I found out
that it had only one memory bug, which was a memory leak I had
documented as a limitation of the POSIX spec for getenv/putenv.  (You
can't tell, when looking at an environment variable, whether or not it
uses allocated space, but when you use putenv() with a piece of
memory, you *lose* that memory, even if it was allocated.)"

Re .yume3-gtkrc : need to decide upon where (if not ~/.yume-gtkrc)
the gtkrc file is going to sit.

In man page, illustrate forms like 
   YUME='/usr/local/bin/yume -Y7 ' ./sho-yume23-samples
for use with scripts that say 
   [ "$YUME" ] || YUME=$(which yume)
near beginning (as per following paragraph).

Done 26 Feb 2011 - 
In examples, replace 'yume ...' in each script with $YUME,
to facilitate testing with not-yet-installed new versions of yume.
Via code like:   [ "$YUME" ] || YUME=$(which yume)


Label Wrappers ---

Label Wrappers options summary: Instead of the "-de 'wrapN:txt" form
mentioned below, where N is a digit, will use forms "-de wsn:txt"
to assign specified label wrapper text to widgets with the specified
name.

Note, wsn is a widget style name chosen from set {y3bg, y3dp, y3dr,
y3ee, y3td, y3iv, y3tv, y3ex, y3vb}, while txt is format text that can
contain Pango markup codes and may or may not contain one %s field[*],
as illustrated below. [* Per (C99? C0x?) std as in n1256.pdf,
sec. 7.19.6.1 par. 2, "If the format is exhausted while arguments
remain, the excess arguments are evaluated [...] but are otherwise
ignored."]  That is, if a wrapper has no %s field in it, resulting
labels will be the same each time the wrapper is used.

Note, set is ordered, and its order must match with enum EntryType.
Ie, { DoPush, DoRoll, DoTxt, DoEE, RoList, BuHid, BuGen, BuFix,
Exitor, InitBu, InitVal, VBox }.

Initial label wrapper text settings are as follows.  Note, with
default yume3-gtkrc, black label letters are used for y3bg and y3dp,
and for y3ee's inactive state.  Red label letters are used for y3dr
and for y3ee's active state.

 y3bg:  "<b>%s</b>"    (bold letters)
 y3dp:  "<b>do:</b>"   (bold letters)
 y3dr:  "<b>Do:</b>"   (bold letters)
 y3ee:  "<b>EE</b>"    (bold letters)
 y3td:  NA
 y3iv:  "<b>%s</b>"    (bold letters)
 y3tv:  NA
 y3vb:  NA

In some example yume files, illustrate settings like the following.

-de y3bg:"<big>%s</big>"  (big letters)
-de y3dp:  "<b><big>do:</big></b>" (big and bold do:)
-de y3dr:  "<span color=\"red\">((((</span><b><big>do:</big></b><span color=\"red\">))))</span>"
           (big and bold "(((( do: ))))", with () in red)

Add label-formatting notes to yume3.1 (man page) explaining "label
wrappers"

Set up -de options for "label wrappers".  Eg, -de 'wrap1:<span
foreground="blue" size="x-large">%s</span>' -de 'wrap2:<span
size="x-large">%s</span>' would set up two wrappers.  Each wrapper
should be a string that is suitable for use as a format in a call to
Gtk function g_markup_printf_escaped().

obs:
Let user define any of fmt0..9 (or possibly w0..9), of which w0..6
have preassigned applications and definitions, and allow each fmt to
be set to a string or to the contents of another fmt; eg, -de w0:7 and
-de "w8:<span etc> %s etc>" such that if a value is a digit, it
denotes a fmt being set to another fmt.

The preassigned app/def numbers are, with ROO standing for "rollover
on", w0: ordinary button; w1: ROO ordinary button; w2: do button; w3:
ROO do button; w4: EE button; w5: ROO EE button (ie, an active EE
toggle button); w6: -iv button.  

Alternately, perhaps after -de "wrap:nn", wrapper #nn is in effect and
applied to all buttons.  [Not a hot plan.]  After -de "wrapnn:..."
definitions, the most-recently stated definition stays in effect until
another -de "wrapnn:..."  definition or a -de "wrap:nn" option
appears.

Using snprintf() rather than g_markup_printf_escaped() to prepare
markup, both the format wrapper and the label itself can contain Pango
Text Attribute Markup Language.  In this approach, if any of the five special
characters in the set { &, <, >, ", ' } are to appear verbatim in a displayed
label, they must be specified by escape sequences from the set { &amp;, &lt;,
&gt;, &quot;, &apos; }. 

[Lists: One list of the five escapes appears near the end of
<http://wiki.maemo.org/Queen_BeeCon_Widget> in section "QBW Warning!
Possible Pango Markup Language inconsistent/unterminated Tag!".  For
html in general, (ie, not for Pango) see
<http://htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/entities/special.html> where
many of the entities will produce error messages like: "Gtk-WARNING
**: Failed to set text from markup due to error parsing markup: Error
on line 1: Entity name 'permil' is not known"]


 If g_markup_printf_escaped() is used
to process the string, any markup within button labels themselves
would be escaped so that it appears literally.  It probably
 
Note, you can use any UTF8 encoding and Pango Text Attribute Markup
Language in button labels.  For list of attributes, see
http://library.gnome.org/devel/pango/stable/PangoMarkupFormat.html



See http://library.gnome.org/devel/pango/stable/PangoMarkupFormat.html
and glib-Simple-XML-Subset-Parser.html#g-markup-printf-escaped

obs: ?
When processing program options, in phase 1 make entries for transient
or order-dependent items so that they can be applied in proper order
during phase 2 form creation.  -- Unless it turns out that a single
phase is enough.  Still don't know how sizing is going to work


============= following items are from ~/src/yume/yume-todo
============= and  ~/src/yume2/todo

Add switches or a means for setting colors via a list of five color
names that's initialized with current settings when yume starts, and
then overridden if a color switch is specified.

A means of setting the default starting colors is to have a program
that plugs options in to the text of yume.  Or could have initializer
modules that set variables then fork to yume proper, which installs
values in certain variables only if they are undefined.

Similarly, add switches for default font names and/or font sizes.

Add switches to specify display text (non-command text) to be shown
with a menu.

Possibly add escape tags or numbered layers of quotes - to simplify
quoting of command sets in yume.  (Or explain how to define and export
shell functions for use in yume.)


done:
Locate the yume todo file or written notes in which I considered how
to not show program params in ps display (by having an initializer
that sets up variables or a pipe to init yume, rather than via
params).  [Note, approach of zeroing argc or nulling argv didn't work]

Add methods for box design - to allow items such as red buttons, drop
down edits of button content, buttons on same line as editable
commands, etc.
in yume-def-init.c -- success of some mallocs not tested -- add tests!

in yume2.c correct
      errorExit (ERR_BADET, L, 32, "Wrong entry type.  e,et,i:",
to
      errorExit (ERR_BADET, L, 31, "Wrong entry type.  e,et,i:",

in yume2.c deal with %ld vs %d cases (if any) where long int
on my x64 system qili doesn't need l but does need it on wiji.



done:
Consider: Allow replacement-labeling of "do:" buttons, ie,
let it be labeled with user string

Consider following change:  After processing params, set
argv[i] = null, for i > 0.  Would make this selectable as
either a yume compilation option, or via a switch, eg -Yz
which turns on flag to wipe params after processing.  
Note, consider whether to memset each param string to 
zero, or just to null the argv[] entries.


obs:
Consider: Rather than above (nulling strings in attempt to disappear
params, which doesn't actually work) as soon as we've processed args,
fork to subprocess and let original process die.  In original process
do a waitpid (?) so original yume can exit cleanly.

obs:
Consider: Remove xforms usage (and requiring its download
and compile) by using Xlib directly, without a toolkit

done:
Consider: Change to GDK (or GTK?) from Xforms so that users
don't need to download and build Xforms

Consider: User-written code to draw and/or update button
appearances

Consider: [re button updates] Expose button characteristics
via shell variables and allow shell code to update in rel time

Consider: For feeding a mixed stream of characters to an app [ie, kbd
input mixed w/ yume'd stuff] see if this works: set stdin of exec'd
app to a pipe from yume

Consider:

-ow or -ox (check letter availability) for "Make an output
 window for results from this command".  The attributes of 
the window might need to be specifiable, eg: "Make a temp
window with a message and an ok button"  or "Make a window
of certain size and tail all the output to it" etc
(How would this work (ie, be done), anyway?)

Consider:

Consider:
