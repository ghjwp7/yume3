Like calc-wrap, calc-wrap2 illustrates use of -iv fields to make a gui
wrapper for a command-line-style calculation program, with edit-boxes
for parameter values and a click button to run the program.  See
calc-wrap and calc-wrap.txt and yume(1) for discussion of -iv.

The main point of calc-wrap2 is exercising some -bw (button-width)
settings.  calc-wrap2 creates 8 menus, all having the same sets of
buttons, but with various ratios of sizes and absolute sizes.

Four combinations of -bw parameters are illustrated.  For each
combination, two menus are created, one with a -at parameter
constraining its size and placement, and the other sized and placed by
the window manager.

When it runs, calc-wrap2 displays some explanatory text on the screen
where examples were started, and for each menu that it generates, it
displays a line like "Creating menu with AT=-at 260x190+0+775, BWA=tz,
and BWB=ni."  The BWA parameter sets the size or size ratio for the
top line of the menu, and BWB does the same for the bottom line.  The
middle three lines (the -iv fields) are sized via -bw dc.
