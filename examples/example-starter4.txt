example-starter4 is very much like example-starter3 except that
it uses  -bw  (button width) codes, to set fixed widths of 
columns of buttons.  Specifically, it uses   -bw daa
which makes the left column 4 times as wide as the middle or
right columns.  The  -bw aa codes divide row length equally 
between two buttons.   Unlike example-starter3, this example-
starter doesn't have a -at geometry specification, and doesn't
define obscure constants buxMargin and buQuanta.



example-starter4 creates a list of examples from the yume examples
directory, finding relevant files with egrep and test -x.  It displays
a tall menu, mostly with three buttons per line, from which examples
can be viewed and run.  In the two-button menu lines, clicking exit
exits; ls lists files in examples directory; and ll lists details.

In the three-button lines, clicking the lefthand button runs the
example corresponding to the button's label.

Clicking the C (for Code) button shows the code of the example, in an
xterm.

Clicking an N (for Note) button will open an xterm and display brief
comments about the example.  The *.txt files in the examples directory
contain Note text, and when there is a file x.txt corresponding to
example file x, there will be an N button to run "less x.txt" in a new
xterm.  If there is no such .txt file, the righthand button will have
a blank label and do nothing.

Pressing q in a Code or Note xterm will close it.
