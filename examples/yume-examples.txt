yume-examples creates a fixed-location menu with two buttons.  One
button invokes example-starter4 to display a list of yume examples;
the other exits from yume.

yume-examples has an optional parameter to specify a path to the
directory of examples.  If no parameter is given and YEGDIR isn't set,
yume-examples assumes the current directory is the examples directory.

Before it starts yume, yume-examples sets shell-variable YEGDIR to the
specified directory (or current directory), changes to that directory,
sets YEGDIR to the current directory, and exports YEGDIR, as follows:

   	    [ $YEGDIR ] || YEGDIR=$1
        [ $YEGDIR ] || YEGDIR=./
        cd $YEGDIR
        export YEGDIR=`pwd`

The yume command in yume-examples is like:

    yume -at 320x60-2+2 -ti "yume example-starter"\
	 -bu -la "Show list of yume examples" ./example-starter3 -ex

The location -2+2 is near the top right corner of the screen.

Typically, button commands need not have an ampersand (&) to run in
background, as yume will fork commands to run in a shell in background
[except possibly in a metamode like %-, for which, see COMMENTS:
Meta-mode 'Commands' in man page].
