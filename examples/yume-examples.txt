yume-examples creates a fixed-location menu with two buttons.  One
button invokes example-starter4 to display a list of yume examples;
the other exits from yume.

yume-examples has an optional parameter to specify a path to the
directory of examples.  If no parameter is given and YEGDIR isn't set,
yume-examples assumes the current directory is the examples directory.

Before it starts yume, yume-examples sets shell-variable YEGDIR to the
specified directory (or current directory), changes to that directory,
sets YEGDIR to the current directory, and exports YEGDIR, as follows:

     	    [ $YEGDIR ] || YEGDIR=$1
	    [ $YEGDIR ] || YEGDIR=./
	    cd $YEGDIR
	    export YEGDIR=`pwd`

The yume command in yume-examples is like:

    yume -at 320x60-2+2 -ti "yume example-starter"\
	 -bu -la "Show list of yume examples" ./example-starter3 -ex &

The location -2+2 is near the top right corner of the screen.

Ordinarily, one would end a button command with an ampersand (&), eg,
"./example-starter3&", but in this case, the yume command in
example-starter3 itself ends with an ampersand (&), so we don't
bother.
