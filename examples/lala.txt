lala - Latest-Latex script
$Id: lala.txt 7 2009-02-25 15:19:11Z j-waldby $

Invoke lala by "lala" or by "lala f" where f represents a filename.
If f appears, rather than finding the most-recently-changed .tex file,
lala finds the base name of f and sets up the yume menu accordingly.
In the rest of this note, $F represents the base name of the selected
.tex file.  lala includes the base name $F in the title line of its
window.

lala locates the most-recently modified *.tex file in the current
working directory, or if given a parameter locates a specified file.
It prepares a yume menu with latex-2ps and lpr -do items, and edit,
latex-2ps, xdvi, ls, ps2pdf, and acroread button commands for that
file.

Buttons act as follows: 'Edit it' edits $F.tex with editor selected as
above.  'latex-2ps' does "latex-2ps $F".  'xdvi it' does "xdvi $BASE".
'Ls it' shows the date and lists $F* files.  'ps2pdf it' does "ps2pdf
$F.ps". 'acroread' does "acroread $F.pdf".

Rename and change lala to suit your own preferences in editors,
viewers, print or store commands, etc, or define an EDITOR shell
variable.  lala selects editor via environment variable $YEDIT, or
$EDITOR if $YEDIT is empty, or emacs if $EDITOR is empty too.

"latex-2ps $F x" item: If you are re-latexing a file quite
frequently, turn on EE mode of this item.  This enables "rollover" or
"mouse-over" mode, in which the command will be performed when the
mouse cursor enters the do: button box.

"lpr -# 1 $F.ps" item: If you want to print multiple copies, change 1
to the number of copies.  If you need to specify a printer, after the
menu appears you can enter a -Plp parameter in the command editing
box.  Or change "lpr -# 1 $BASE.ps" to "lpr -P$PRINTER -# 1 $BASE.ps"
(or other appropriate value) by editing lala.

latex-2ps latexs the specified tex file if itâ€™s newer than its dvi
file, or if a third parameter is given.  latex-2ps runs latex
invisibly unless an error occurs.  It beeps when done if latex
finishes without error; but if a latex error occurs, it uses script
latex-2err to present selected latex error log messages in an xterm
window.
