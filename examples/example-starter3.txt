example-starter3 creates a list of examples from the yume examples
directory, finding relevant files with egrep and test -x.  It displays
a tall menu, mostly with three buttons per line, from which examples
can be viewed and run.  In the two-button menu lines, clicking exit
exits; ls lists files in examples directory; and ll lists details.

In the three-button lines, clicking the lefthand button runs the
example corresponding to the button's label.

Clicking the C (for Code) button shows the code of the example, in an
xterm.

Clicking an N (for Note) button will open an xterm and display brief
comments about the example.  The *.txt files in the examples directory
contain Note text, and when there is a file x.txt corresponding to
example file x, there will be an N button to run "less x.txt" in a new
xterm.  If there is no such .txt file, the righthand button will have
a blank label and do nothing.

Pressing q in a Code or Note xterm will close it. 


example-starter3 shows further variations on shell quoting, using
echo and xargs.  Either of the commands
               yume $L &
or
               yume "$L" &
would treat the string 'xterm -e less x.txt' within $L as four
parameters ("'xterm", "-e", "less", and "x.txt'"), but using echo and
xargs causes it to be properly treated as one parameter to yume.
