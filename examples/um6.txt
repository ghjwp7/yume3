um6 illustrates use of xclip.  When you drop an IP number or internet
machine name on the Host/Whois/Dig button, the script puts the IP
number into shell variable IP, then in turn invokes host, whois, and
dig to get data about the IP number.  Output from each command is
filtered by grep -v commands, to suppress some uninteresting,
repetitive stuff.
