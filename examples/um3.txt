um3 illustrates a yume menu button that opens an xterm window of
specified size and displays output or file within it.  The user can
close the display by pressing q.  This particular example puts output
from "cal -3", a three-month calendar, into a 69x9 character
large-print xterm, that is, an xterm no larger than needed and quite
visible.

It also illustrates use of yume buttons to control two CD functions,
with cdplay and eject.
