# simple test case for yume's -in option
# In this example, no line begins or ends with a blank.
#
# The result of "yume -in in-test-1 &" should look just 
# like the first menu that test-y-1 creates via
#
# yume -ex df -at 280x280+0+300 -do date "df ." ls -bu \
# date -la 'Bye-bye' -ex -la lsa "ls -a" -bu a b  \
# xwininfo -ex -ti "${0}a woo hoo" &
