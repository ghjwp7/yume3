$YUME -at 100x50+$X+1 -ti $H -bw ba -bu -la $H "gnome-terminal" -ex

# This example makes a menu with one button, labeled with the hostname
# of the machine running the yume command, or if a parameter is given,
# with that text.  When you click the button, it opens an xterm from
# the machine where the yume command was run.

# The example illustrates a simple technique for placing the buttons
# at different locations on your screen, depending on what host you
# are logged into.  For the example, if you are logged into zeda when
# you run menu-at-var with no parameters (or if you say "menu-at-var
# zeda"), the menu will appear at +201+1; if yuli, at +101+1; if some
# other, at +1+1.  All these locations are close to the top left
# corner of the screen.
