A menu with buttons for "subversion" control.

This menu appears to work ok but probably could be better organized to
be more useful, more comfortable, and less likely to do something you
don't want done, such as committing or updating before time.

It uses -iv fields so that the user can specify a directory and a
files list.  The directory is relative to the path shown in the top
button.

The script lines 
     # Change EDIT to what you prefer
     export EDIT=emacs
are there because my usual setting of EDITOR, /usr/local/bin/x2, is
for a script that starts emacs in background.  This is unsuitable for
svn commit, which comes up with a misleading Abort - Continue - Edit
dialog.

The "Props-id" button leads to a 'svn propset svn:keywords "Date Id"'
command.

Use of -bw cccc with no -at should lead to a button-size large enough
to hold up to 9 characters of label text.  However, in my tests they
are in fact large enough to hold about twice that many characters, as
a consequence of the long title of the top button.
