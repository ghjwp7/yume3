calc-wrap illustrates use of -iv fields to make a gui wrapper for a
command-line-style calculation program, with edit-boxes for parameter
values and a click button to run the program.

This example supposes that the calculation program requires three
parameters.  It puts values into yume-environment variables Diam,
Leng, and Freq, with initial values 1, 300, and 2000000 respectively,
as found in the -iv parameter strings.  

For example, the script line

 -bu -la 'Wire length, mm:' -la Leng -iv 300\

acts as follows:

-bu starts a new line of buttons.  If this were not present, the
initial-value field would be part of a line of buttons, rather than on
a line by itself.

-iv needs two -la label strings, one to use for a shell-variable name
and one to use as a visual label for the button next to the edit-box.

Thus, "-la Leng" pushes shell-variable-name Leng onto yume's label
stack, and -la 'Wire length, mm:' pushes button-label 'Wire length,
mm:'.  

The "-iv 300" part tells yume to create an initial-value item, and
gives Leng its initial value of 300.

The bottom line of the menu, with an exit and a Calc button, is
created by

    -bu -ex -la Calc './calc-prog $Diam $Leng $Freq' &

such that when the Calc button is clicked, the current values of Diam,
Leng, and Freq are substituted into the calc-prog command line.
If the button command had been (mis)quoted with double quotes, ie,

    -bu -ex -la Calc "./calc-prog $Diam $Leng $Freq" &

which is wrong, then substitution would have taken place before yume
ran.
