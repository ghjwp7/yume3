um4's "Clip url -> FF" button gets a URL from the clipboard, via
"xclip -o".  It deletes any newlines within the URL, via "tr -d '\n'".
In the command, '\n' is quoted by " marks, ie, as "'\n'".  Strings
    'firefox "`xclip -o | tr -d '
and 
    '`"'
are concatenated to the front and rear of
    "'\n'"
and the resulting string
    firefox "`xclip -o | tr -d '\n'`"
is used by yume as a single parameter.

For example, if you select text http://www.google.com (in linux, by
moving the mouse cursor to h, pressing left mouse button, then moving
the mouse cursor to m, then releasing the left mouse button) and click
the "Clip url -> FF" button, the www.google.com webpage should open in
firefox.

um4's "Ebay# -> FF" button creates a URL like
    http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=400032181378
when an item number like 400032181378 is dropped on it.
