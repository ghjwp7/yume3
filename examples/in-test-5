# in-test-3,4,5 --
# These three files make up a simple nested-includes 
# test case for yume's -in option, in which 
# in-test-3 nests in-test-4, which nests in-test-5,
# which nests in-test-1, which is terminal.

# Because we want in-test-1 to start in on a new line,
# we have a -bu before the -in in-test-1 line.  But as
# in-test-1 usually starts at top level, we need -do also,
# to switch to the mode it expects to start in.

# Note that command "yume -in in-test-3 &" creates a menu much like
# that of in-test-1, except with one line of three buttons added on
# top, and one line of three buttons added on bottom.  The added top
# line has buttons labeled In-test-3, In-test-4, In-test-5, created as
# we nest down.  The added bottom line has buttons labeled in-Test-5,
# in-Test-4, in-Test-3, created as we come back up.

-la In-test-5 -ex -bu -do
-in in-test-1
