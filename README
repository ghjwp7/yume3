yume is a menu system with user-editable, mouse-activated shell
commands.  It creates and runs a menu based on user-provided
arguments. The current version, yume3, is Gtk-based, while a previous
version (yume2) is based on the xforms library for X Window System,
and an original version (vintage 1997) is Tcl/TK based.

To make yume, see directions in INSTALL.  That file explains how to
unpack the source files, and how to make yume.  Note, as of January
2018, the latest yume release is in a git repository on github.  A
file docs-HTML/yume3-doc-eg02.tgz (ca 465KB) on SourceForge contains a
web page, eg-overview.html, and about 44 .jpg screen shots of menus
generated with yume3.  I'll migrate it to github when I learn how.

An example:  The input

      yume -bu date ls -ex &

creates a menu window with three buttons, labeled date, ls, exit.
Clicking the button labeled date runs the date command and displays
the result in the window where yume started; clicking the ls button
runs the ls command; clicking exit closes the menu window.


As another example:  The input

      yume -do 'ls -al' 'cal -3' &

makes a menu window with two "do" items, with command text in an
editing box where you can change it, and with the option to turn
on "roll-over" operation, where an item is executed when the mouse
cursor crosses it.

For more examples, cd to the yume3/examples directory after you make
yume, and enter the command ./yume-examples.  Also, see man yume and
man yume-examples.

Bug notes:
1. As of 18 Jan 2018, any examples that use exported shell functions
won't run correctly if default shell dash is v. 0.5.8 or later, as it
is for Ubuntu 15 and later.  A branch to fix this issue is underway.

2. Misleadingly, the INSTALL doc refers to files at sourceforge
