yume is a menu system with user-editable, mouse-activated shell
commands.  It creates and runs a menu based on user-provided
arguments. The current version, yume3, is Gtk-based, while a previous
version (yume2) is based on the xforms library for X Window System,
and an original version (vintage 1997) is Tcl/TK based.

To make yume, see directions in INSTALL.  That file explains how to
unpack the source files, and how to make yume.  Note, as of January
2018, the latest yume release is in a git repository on github.
Briefly, after cloning the repository, `cd yume3`, then for typical
linux systems, `make` and `sudo make install`.  The INSTALL file tells
(generally) how to get Gtk libraries if not already on-system, and
where `make install` puts linked binaries and man pages.

The yume3 wiki at <https://github.com/ghjwp7/yume3/wiki> has a "yume
screen shot examples" page, with links to images, code, and notes
working ok.  The wiki also has links for PDF files with man pages for
yume and yume-examples.

Here is an example using yume:  The input

      yume -bu date ls -ex &

creates a menu window with three buttons, labeled date, ls, exit.
Clicking the button labeled date runs the date command and displays
the result in the window where yume started; clicking the ls button
runs the ls command; clicking exit closes the menu window.


As another example:  The input

      yume -do 'ls -al' 'cal -3' &

makes a menu window with two "do" items, with command text in an
editing box where you can change it, and with the option to turn
on "roll-over" operation, where an item is executed when the mouse
cursor crosses it.

For more examples, cd to the yume3/examples directory after you make
yume, and enter the command ./yume-examples.  Also, see man yume and
man yume-examples.  The /web subdirectory includes HTML and pdf
versions of screen-shots of most yume-examples scripts.

Bug note: As of 22 Jan 2018, examples that use exported shell
functions should run correctly; the 'pipewise1' branch to fix an issue
was merged in.  (There is an issue with earlier versions of yume where
exported shell functions don't show up if running dash 0.5.8 / Ubuntu
15 or later.)
