yume is a menu system with user-editable, mouse-activated shell
commands.  It creates and runs a menu based on user-provided
arguments. The current version, yume3, is Gtk-based, while the
previous version (yume2) is based on the xforms library for X Window
System.

To make yume, see directions in INSTALL.  That file explains how to
unpack the source files, and how to make yume.  Note, as of 17 March
2011, latest yume3 release is contained in file yume3-005.tgz
(ca 103KB).  The file docs-HTML/yume3-doc-eg02.tgz (ca 465KB) on
SourceForge contains a web page, eg-overview.html, and about 44 .jpg
screen shots of menus generated with yume3.

An example:  The input

      yume -bu date ls -ex &

creates a menu window with three buttons, labeled date, ls, exit.
Clicking the button labeled date runs the date command and displays
the result in the window where yume started; clicking the ls button
runs the ls command; clicking exit closes the menu window.


As another example:  The input

      yume -do 'ls -al' 'cal -3' &

makes a menu window with two "do" items, with command text in an
editing box where you can change it, and with the option to turn
on "roll-over" operation, where an item is executed when the mouse
cursor crosses it.

For more examples, cd to the yume3/examples directory after you
make yume, and enter the command ./yume-examples.  Also, see 
man yume and man yume-examples.
