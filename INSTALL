yume is a menu system with user-editable, mouse-activated shell
commands.  It creates and runs a menu according to user-provided
arguments.  For more information and examples, please see README and
man yume and man yume-examples.

The current version of yume is Gtk3-based.  Current source code is in
a git repo at https://github.com/ghjwp7/yume3 while some obsolete
versions are at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/yume3/> and
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/yume2/>, the latter based on the
xforms library for X Window System rather than Gtk.

         ____________________________________________________

How to get the Gtk libraries which yume uses to draw graphic objects:

If your system does not already have Gtk development libraries
available, please see <http://www.gtk.org/download.html>, which has
URL's for linux/unix, MS-Windows, and OSX or MacOS versions of Gtk
software.  

Many linux distributions include a few dozen Gtk-based software and
support libraries as required for use with Gnome.  Even if your system
is Gnome-based, you still may need to install Gtk development header
files, as found (typically) in /usr/include/gtk-3.0/gtk/.  For
example, try the command "locate gtk.h" to see if that header file is
available.  If it is not, use your system's package manager to install
a package with name like "gtk3-devel - " and a version number.  For
example, on vintage Fedora Core distributions: sudo pirut; click the
Search tab; put Gtk in the search box; click the Search button.  Then
locate and click a checkbox next to appropriate library entry, and
click Apply.

On Ubuntu distributions, eg:    sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev

To make yume after unpacking it, enter the commands

          cd yume3
          make
          sudo make install


In more detail: Download the latest yume tgz file.  Let us suppose
yume3-abc.tgz has been downloaded to <path>.  (For example, you might
have downloaded yume3-v005.tgz to ~/Downloads.)  Enter the commands

          cd <path>
          tar xzf yume3-abc.tgz
          cd yume3; make; sudo make install


The command 
    	    make

in the above will compile and link the several modules of yume3,
and will also compile a small program yume (from source yumex.c).
It also will copy yume3/examples/yume-gtkrc to $HOME/.yume-gtkrc.
If you are reinstalling yume3 and have a .yume-gtkrc file that
you have customized, make a backup copy of it first.  If you run
make as root rather than an ordinary user, .yume-gtkrc will be
installed in /root/, which may be not what you want.


The command
          sudo make install

in the above will install yume in /usr/local/bin and yume man pages in
/usr/share/man/man1.  If you prefer to install yume elsewhere, copy or
move yume3/bin/yume to the preferred bin/ directory, or link to it.
For example, if <path> is the location where you unpacked yume3:

          cd yume3/
          mv bin/yume ~/bin
-or-
          cd ~/bin
          ln -s  <path>/yume3/bin/yume



If you don't install the man pages in /usr/share/man/man1, use the
following forms to read them.  (Use the ./ path when yume.1 is in
current directory.)

          man <path>/yume3/doc/yume.1
          man <path>/yume3/doc/yume-examples.1
          man <path>/yume3/doc/yume.1
          man ./yume.1



To try out yume script and menu examples, after making yume, use:

          cd yume3/examples
          ./yume-examples
-or-
          <path>/yume3/examples/yume-examples  <path>/yume3/examples

The current directory should be yume3/examples when trying examples,
or you should give yume-examples a path parameter, to tell it where to
find examples.
